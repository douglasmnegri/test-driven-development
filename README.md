This project contains a series of utility functions and their corresponding tests written using Jest. The functions include `capitalize`, `analyzeArray`, `caesarCipher`, `calculator`, and `reverseString`.

## Functions

### `capitalize`

The `capitalize` function takes a string as input and returns the string with the first character capitalized and the rest in lowercase.

### `analyzeArray`

The `analyzeArray` function takes an array of numbers as input and returns an object containing the average, minimum, maximum, and length of the array.

### `caesarCipher`
